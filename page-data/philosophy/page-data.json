We are a welcoming and loving community for cinephiles, movie critics, filmmakers and potential filmmakers at MIT, Harvard, and all other colleges/schools around Boston. We hope to create a platform for many talents, under the guidance from advisors, to thrive and shine. Our films will keep valuable footage about the popular culture of MIT students as well as all walks of life in this vibrant city. Our association is funded by MIT GSC.\n\n# Philosophy\n\nThe MIT Film Makers Association is home to a community of creators who are devoted to the art of filmmaking. We believe that storytelling and filmmaking should be accessible to everyone and are dedicated to providing resources for members of the MIT community to create and share meaningful content. We are also interested in bridging the gap between visual arts and technology to explore and create new types of content and stories. We provide opportunities for members to create films, meet other creators, and learn more about filmmaking through events and workshops.\n"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
